### You can calculate from Mayer bond orders

- coordinations numbers,
- Qi units,
- Connections between atoms,
- Relation between bond order and length,
- Covalence (The sum of the bond orders of a given atom. This  value is close to the valence if atom have only purely covalent bonds)

### You can also use application using this library.
